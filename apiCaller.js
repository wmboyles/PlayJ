// Not all of the below TODO's will necessarily be done. It depends on the design and features we include.

// TODO: some state variables: maybe a air date (if we're doing that), categories, or questions/answers.

// TODO: a function that selects 6 different categories, each with questions that have the right dollar amounts.

// TODO: a function that takes an object from create.js and fills in the information for the corresponding question.
